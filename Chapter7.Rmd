# Exercise 7.3
# In this case, you will see that the Metropolis algorithm operates with multimodal distributions. 
# A. Consider a prior distribution on coin bias that puts most credibility at 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0, which we will formulate as p(theta) = (cos(4piTheta)+1)^2/1.5 
# B. Make a plot of the prior 
theta = seq(0,1,length = 501);
plot(theta, (cos(4*pi*theta)+1)^2/1.5)
# C. In the script BernMetrop.R, find the function that specifies the prior distribution. Inside that function definition, comment out the line that assigns a beta density to pTheta, and instead put in a trimodal prior
